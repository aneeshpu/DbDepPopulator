Good tests run on all environments by setting up its own data and tearing it down after the run. But still we end up either not writing tests or writing tests that expect data to be already setup. No tests are no good and tests that run on specific environments are not very good either. \r\n\r\nOne place that I have often found the above problems is in tests for DAOs that talk to an RDBMS. One reason that I have found is that foreign keys make the setup tedious. If I had to write a test for the DAO for table A which has a fk to B which has a fk to c etc etc, the bulk of the test quickly becomes setup code. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
